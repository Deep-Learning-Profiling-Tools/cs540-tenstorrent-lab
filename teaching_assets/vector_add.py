"""Source-checked TT-Lang single-core vector-add teaching baseline.

Adapted from official examples/eltwise_add.py. Device validation is pending.
The host harness pads N finite values to 1024 * ceil(N/1024), reshapes them to
(32 * ceil(N/1024), 32), allocates a, b, out in FP32 tiled device storage and calls
vector_add(a, b, out). It compares only the first N values after unpacking.
Host allocation is handled by the course runner.
